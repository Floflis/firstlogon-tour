About "body: Stepper(", how to remove these "Continue" and "Cancel" buttons?








To remove the "Continue" and "Cancel" buttons from the Stepper widget in Flutter, you can use the controlsBuilder property. This property allows you to override the default controls with your own widget. If you want to remove the buttons, you can return an empty Container.

Here is how you can do it:

Stepper(
  controlsBuilder: (BuildContext context, {VoidCallback onStepContinue, VoidCallback onStepCancel}) {
    return Container();
  },
  // other properties...
)

This will replace the default controls with an empty Container, effectively removing the "Continue" and "Cancel" buttons.

Please apply this change to the Stepper widget in your code. For example, in the file lib/screens/steps/steps.dart from line 228 to line 244.

The error you're encountering is due to the null safety feature in Dart. The controlsBuilder function parameters onStepContinue and onStepCancel are non-nullable, but you're not providing them any value, which is causing the error.

To fix this, you can provide an empty function for onStepContinue and onStepCancel parameters. Here's how you can do it:

Stepper(
  controlsBuilder: (BuildContext context, {VoidCallback? onStepContinue, VoidCallback? onStepCancel}) {
    return Container();
  },
  // other properties...
)

Please apply this change to the Stepper widget in your code. For example, in the file lib/screens/steps/steps.dart from line 228 to line 244.

The error you're encountering is due to the mismatch of the function signature of controlsBuilder. The controlsBuilder function expects a ControlsDetails object as the second parameter, not two separate callbacks.

To fix this, you need to modify the controlsBuilder function to match the expected signature. Here's how you can do it:

Stepper(
  controlsBuilder: (BuildContext context, {required ControlsDetails controlsDetails}) {
    return Container();
  },
  // other properties...
)

In this code, controlsDetails is a ControlsDetails object that contains onStepContinue and onStepCancel callbacks. Since you're not using these callbacks, you can ignore this object.

Please apply this change to the Stepper widget in your code. For example, in the file lib/screens/steps/steps.dart from line 228 to line 244.

The error message indicates that the controlsBuilder function in your Stepper widget is not correctly defined. The controlsBuilder function should take two parameters: BuildContext and ControlsDetails. However, in your code, it seems like you're trying to pass three parameters.

Here is the correct way to define the controlsBuilder function:

controlsBuilder: (BuildContext context, {required ControlsDetails controlsDetails}) {
  return Container();
},

You can see this in the code block:

  controlsBuilder: (BuildContext context, {required ControlsDetails controlsDetails}, {VoidCallback? onStepContinue, VoidCallback? onStepCancel}) {
    return Container();
  },
  
Please correct the controlsBuilder function in your Stepper widget to match the correct definition.
