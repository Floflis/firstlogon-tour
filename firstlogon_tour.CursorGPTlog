In steps.dart, how to make the cards (and their InkWell father elements) appearing in-line rather than one atop another?








To make the cards appear in-line rather than one atop another, you need to wrap the Card widgets inside a Row widget. The Row widget in Flutter allows you to align its children widgets in a horizontal manner.

Here's how you can modify the code:

Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    InkWell(
      // ... existing InkWell code for first card ...
    ),
    InkWell(
      // ... existing InkWell code for second card ...
    ),
    // Add more InkWell widgets for additional cards
  ],
)

You can apply this modification to the relevant parts of your code. For instance, in the code block starting from line 28 in steps.dart, you can wrap the InkWell widgets inside a Row widget.

Remember to adjust the mainAxisAlignment and crossAxisAlignment properties of the Row widget to control the alignment and spacing of the cards.
