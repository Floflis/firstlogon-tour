For my surprise, in welcome.dart, $Directory.current.path works, showing the current path the Flutter app is running from.












The error you're encountering is due to the use of $Directory in your app.dart file. In Dart, the $ symbol is used for string interpolation, not for accessing global variables or classes.

In your welcome.dart file, you're using ${Directory.current.path} inside a string, which is the correct way to use string interpolation.

To fix the error in app.dart, you should replace $Directory with Directory:

var process = await Process.run('bash', [Directory.current.path,'/include/linux-icon-getter/./linux-icon-getter', 'distributor-logo']);

This should correctly pass the current directory path to the Process.run function.

Remember to import the dart:io package at the top of your app.dart file to use the Directory class:

import 'dart:io';

This should resolve the Undefined name '$Directory' error you're encountering.










Thank you!

Beyond successfully compiling, now I'm finally rid of that gray square appearing bellow the "Start Setup" button: now there's a text saying "Unsupported image format".

Please tell me a preview of how "var process = await Process.run('bash', [Directory.current.path,'/include/linux-icon-getter/./linux-icon-getter', 'distributor-logo']);" runs the commands. Exactly the command that is run.

Are that somewhat like "bash /home/daniella/firstlogon_tour/build/linux/x64/release/bundle/include/linux-icon-getter/./linux-icon-getter distributor-logo"?








Yes, you're correct. The Process.run function in Dart runs a process and collects its output. When you pass 'bash' as the command and an array of arguments, it constructs a command line string and executes it.

In your case, the command that is run would be:

bash /home/daniella/firstlogon_tour/include/linux-icon-getter/./linux-icon-getter distributor-logo

This command is executed in the shell, and the output is captured by the Process.run function. The Directory.current.path returns the current working directory of the Dart process, which is /home/daniella/firstlogon_tour in your case.

The "Unsupported image format" error you're seeing is likely due to the image format returned by the linux-icon-getter script not being supported by the flutter_svg package. You might need to convert the image to a supported format (like PNG or JPEG) before displaying it in your Flutter app.
