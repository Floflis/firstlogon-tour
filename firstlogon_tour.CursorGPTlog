In welcome.dart, how to make "'Please note that currently only Cinnamon is supported; GNOME and other desktop environments soon!'" as small as a <small> HTML-equivalent?








In Flutter, you can use the TextStyle widget to adjust the font size of a Text widget. To make the text smaller, you can reduce the fontSize property. Here's how you can do it:

Text(
  'Please note that currently only Cinnamon is supported; GNOME and other desktop environments soon!',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 12.0), // Adjust the font size here
),

This code is in the welcome.dart file:

                  Text(
                    'Please note that currently only Cinnamon is supported; GNOME and other desktop environments soon!',
                    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
                  ),
                  
You can adjust the fontSize value to suit your needs. The value is in logical pixels, so a smaller value will result in smaller text.
