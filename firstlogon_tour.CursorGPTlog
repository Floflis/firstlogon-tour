The error message indicates that the controlsBuilder function in the Stepper widget is not returning a widget. The controlsBuilder function is expected to return a widget that describes the controls below each step.

In the provided code, the controlsBuilder function is returning a Container without any child, which is causing the error.

controlsBuilder: (BuildContext context) {
  return Container();
},

To fix this error, you need to return a widget that describes the controls. For example, you can return a Row widget with two TextButton widgets for "CONTINUE" and "CANCEL" actions. Here is an example:

controlsBuilder: (BuildContext context, {VoidCallback? onStepContinue, VoidCallback? onStepCancel}) {
  return Row(
    children: <Widget>[
      TextButton(
        onPressed: onStepContinue,
        child: const Text('CONTINUE'),
      ),
      TextButton(
        onPressed: onStepCancel,
        child: const Text('CANCEL'),
      ),
    ],
  );
},

This will add "CONTINUE" and "CANCEL" buttons below each step. You can customize this to fit your needs.
