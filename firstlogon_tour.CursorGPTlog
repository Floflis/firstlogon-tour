Let's make this app surprisingly, blazingly fast to be openned right after clicked.

Let's load as the first thing, a spinner at the center; it will disappear when everything is loaded.











To make the app load faster, you can display a spinner at the center of the screen while the rest of the app is loading. This can be achieved by using a FutureBuilder in Flutter.

In your app.dart and welcome.dart files, you are already using FutureBuilder to display a CircularProgressIndicator while waiting for the Executable.getOSName() function to complete.

You can extend this concept to cover the entire app loading process. Here's how you can modify your main.dart file to display a spinner while the app is loading:

void main() {
  runApp(AppLoader());
}

class AppLoader extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FutureBuilder(
        future: Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)), // Simulate a loading delay
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          } else {
            return FirstLogonTourApp();
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

In this example, I've simulated a loading delay with Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)). Replace this with your actual loading process.

Remember, the goal is to make your app load as quickly as possible. Therefore, try to minimize the work done during app startup. If there are tasks that can be deferred until after the app has loaded, consider doing so.
