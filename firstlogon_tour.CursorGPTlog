The error message you're seeing is due to incorrect usage of the print function in Dart. The print function in Dart only takes one argument. If you want to print multiple items, you can concatenate them into a single string.

In your case, you're trying to print a command that you're running. You can do this by joining the command and its arguments into a single string and then printing that string.

Here's how you can modify your code:

print('bash ' + [Directory.current.path,'/data/flutter_assets/include/linux-icon-getter/linux-icon-getter', 'distributor-logo'].join(' '));

This will join the elements of the list into a single string with spaces in between, and then print that string.
