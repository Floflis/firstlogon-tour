The error messages indicate that the [buildSteps()](file:///media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/ProgramsApps/firstlogon_tour/lib/screens/steps/steps.dart#20%2C12-20%2C12) function is being called without the required positional argument BuildContext context. Also, SystemNavigator.pop() is not defined.

To fix these issues, you need to pass the BuildContext context to the _buildSteps() function and replace SystemNavigator.pop() with Navigator.of(context).pop().

Here are the changes you need to make:

In the steps.dart file:

            steps: _buildSteps(),
            
In the step3.dart file:

    SystemNavigator.pop();
    
After making these changes, try building the project again.










This doesn't make sense.

steps.dart do really have " steps: _buildSteps(),", so as step3.dart having "SystemNavigator.pop();" already.












I apologize for the confusion. The issue is that the [buildSteps()](file:///media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/ProgramsApps/firstlogon_tour/lib/screens/steps/steps.dart#20%2C12-20%2C12) function is expecting a BuildContext as an argument, but it's being called without any arguments. Similarly, SystemNavigator.pop() is not a recognized function in Flutter.

Here's how you can fix these issues:

In the steps.dart file, change the _buildSteps() function calls to include the context argument:

steps: _buildSteps(context),

if (_currentStep < _buildSteps(context).length - 1) {

In the step3.dart file, replace SystemNavigator.pop() with Navigator.of(context).pop():

Navigator.of(context).pop();

After making these changes, try building the project again.
