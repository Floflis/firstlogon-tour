r4 (fl attempt 48):

- frameless window, diminish that top header/bar https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63397479/flutter-desktop-frameless-window-support
- ask chatgpt if this sizing is the page's padding or a pre-set window size; ask to set it bound the page size, so make that window smaller

Current drawbacks:
- stepper should be a sidebar, not atop the content putting it doooooown
- Only Cinnamon supported (should support GNOME and other popular DEs such as KDE)
- Focus on Yaru-floflis themes, and Floflis icons (should support beyond Floflis: Ubuntu and all of its flavors starting by UCR)
