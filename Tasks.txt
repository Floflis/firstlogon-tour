r3 (fl attempt 47):

- stepscustom.dart: use it to run custom steps before the laststep /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/ProgramsApps/firstlogon_tour/lib/screens/steps/custom/stepscustom.dart.soon ; document that at dev.md

- cmd/path bug after installed from deb: bash /home/daniella/data/flutter_assets/include/linux-icon-getter/linux-icon-getter distributor-logo

- platform: support multi-arch, such as arm64 and armhf + cross-compiling

- ask to install MS Edge (display terms first)
- ask to install MS Calc

- merge into this repo: /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/HTML5/System/FirstLogonTour (rmv + re-add github branch)

[REPRODUCE ALL ON FMWK-FLUTTER, then add back at davidLauncher]

r4 (fl attempt 48):

- leverage firstlogon_tour-cli's gsettings calls
- change the displayed cards (mouse cursor, theme) and their images according to firstlogon-tour_cli output! /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/ProgramsApps/firstlogon_tour/assets/img/screens/steps/themecolor/ubuntu
- same for when not displaying light theme card when not floflis: detect by /1 rather than literally Floflis (so support its forks)

README.md:
Compatible with:
- Floflis
- Ubuntu Cinnamon 22+
- Linux Mint 21.1+ Cinnamon
- Ubuntu 23+

- add test PNG icon to run in taskbar
- init-newbie.sh: will install flutter and inkscape
- build.sh: an inkscape command for generating the flutter icon out of a svg

- frameless window, diminish that top header/bar https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63397479/flutter-desktop-frameless-window-support
- ask chatgpt if this sizing is the page's padding or a pre-set window size; ask to set it bound the page size, so make that window smaller

Current drawbacks:
- stepper should be a sidebar, not atop the content putting it doooooown
- Only Cinnamon supported (should support GNOME and other popular DEs such as KDE)
- Focus on Yaru-floflis themes, and Floflis icons (should support beyond Floflis: Ubuntu and all of its flavors starting by UCR)
