- enable to export to .deb
https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_to_debian
https://github.com/jeffrey0606/flutter_to_debian (PR to fix 'debain')
then add .deb instructions to /media/daniella/Seagate Expansion Drive/flo-bkp-sync_custom/CursorAI_promptRules.txt
and copy deb features to /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/HTML5/B2G/davidLauncher/cinnamon

Current drawbacks:
- Only Cinnamon supported (should support GNOME and other popular DEs such as KDE)
- Focus on Yaru-floflis themes, and Floflis icons (should support beyond Floflis: Ubuntu and all of its flavors starting by UCR)

- fix all multistep issues and enable multistep from separate files /home/daniella/firstlogon_tour/lib/screens/steps

HOW HELLISH IS TO STYLIZE YOUR FLUTTER APP https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/flutter-for/web-devs
but here's the savior: https://docs.flutter-view.io/guide/styling-with-css https://docs.flutter-view.io/
then apply this savior to /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/HTML5/B2G/davidLauncher/cinnamon as well

FMWK r3+ support Flutter+FlutterView, then use it!
