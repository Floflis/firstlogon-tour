- leverage firstlogon_tour-cli, even its gsettings calls from it. inside sh: detect username, which will be useful for changing Cinnamon applet settings. also inside sh: run cmds according to the linux distro (see "Current drawbacks" CTRL+F) pair its features with firstlogon_tour (GUI) /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/Floflis-DNA/layers/soil/to-merge/include-firstlogon/System/firstlogon-tour_cli

https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_to_debian

- add test PNG icon to run in taskbar
- build.sh: will run "flutter build linux" and an inkscape command for generating the flutter icon out of a svg
- init-newbie.sh: will install flutter and inkscape

open https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-welcome after done, if Ubuntu (or its flavors) is detected

r4 (fl attempt 48):

- give it to the ubuntu and the larger debian community https://github.com/Floflis/firstlogon-tour/issues/1#issuecomment-1720800376

- frameless window, diminish that top header/bar https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63397479/flutter-desktop-frameless-window-support
- ask chatgpt if this sizing is the page's padding or a pre-set window size; ask to set it bound the page size, so make that window smaller

Current drawbacks:
- stepper should be a sidebar, not atop the content putting it doooooown
- Only Cinnamon supported (should support GNOME and other popular DEs such as KDE)
- Focus on Yaru-floflis themes, and Floflis icons (should support beyond Floflis: Ubuntu and all of its flavors starting by UCR)
