GENERATING PROJECT...
Step 0
Computing project structure
To create this project, we will need several files for different purposes. Here's a breakdown of the files and their purposes:
1. `pubspec.yaml`: This is the package file for Dart projects. It will contain the project metadata and dependencies.
2. `main.dart`: This is the main entry point of the Flutter application. It will contain the main function and will call the runApp function with the MyApp class.
3. `app.dart`: This file will contain the MyApp class which is a StatelessWidget. This is the root widget of the application.
4. `welcome_screen.dart`: This file will contain the WelcomeScreen widget. This is the first screen that the user will see when they open the application.
5. `step_screen.dart`: This file will contain the StepScreen widget. This screen will be shown for each step of the tour/wizard.
6. `executable.dart`: This file will contain the code to open an external executable.
7. `README.md`: This file will contain the instructions to compile and run the application.
The order of creation should be as follows:
1. `pubspec.yaml`: This file should be created first as it contains the project metadata and dependencies.
2. `main.dart`: This file should be created next as it is the main entry point of the application.
3. `app.dart`: This file should be created next as it contains the root widget of the application.
4. `welcome_screen.dart`: This file should be created next as it contains the first screen of the application.
5. `step_screen.dart`: This file should be created next as it contains the screens for each step of the tour/wizard.
6. `executable.dart`: This file should be created next as it contains the code to open an external executable.
7. `README.md`: This file should be created last as it contains the instructions to compile and run the application.
Now, let's call the function with these filenames:
```typescript
functions.outputFileNames({
  fileNames: [
   "pubspec.yaml",
   "main.dart",
   "app.dart",
   "welcome_screen.dart",
   "step_screen.dart",
   "executable.dart",
   "README.md"
  ]
});
```
