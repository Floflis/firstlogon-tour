The error message you're seeing is due to the [buildSteps()](file:///media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis/ProgramsApps/firstlogon_tour/lib/screens/steps/steps.dart#20%2C12-20%2C12) function requiring a BuildContext argument, but it's being called without any arguments in two places in your steps.dart file.

To fix this, you need to pass the BuildContext to the _buildSteps() function. Here's how you can do it:

In the steps.dart file, change the following lines:

steps: _buildSteps(),

to

steps: _buildSteps(context),

and

if (_currentStep < _buildSteps().length - 1) {

to

if (_currentStep < _buildSteps(context).length - 1) {

Refer to the following code block:

            steps: _buildSteps(),
            
After making these changes, try building your application again.
