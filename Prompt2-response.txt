To add more steps and move them to separate files, you can create a new Dart file for each step. Each file will contain a Step widget that you can customize according to your needs.

For example, you can create a new file called step1.dart:

You can do the same for step2.dart, step3.dart, and so on.

For the last step, you can add a "Finalize" button that closes the app. Here's an example of how you can do this:
